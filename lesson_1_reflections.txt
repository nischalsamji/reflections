How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

I actually did not use diff as I was using windows. I used fc and have to face an error on the first try.
"Files too different" Then I re-checked the files to sse that if I missed pasting some thing.
I missed the header part completely and that caused havoc.
Repasted everything and it worked fine. When I saw spacr instead of space I identified it as the bug.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

When we mark the history, it is easier tot track changes that were done in the past. It also helps in bug fixing and to revert
any changes that need to be reverted.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros
Control over the commits.
Add comments
Use discretion over this.

Cons.
Forgetting may prove fatal.
Power-losses, system interruptions may prove fatal.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log is used to track all the commits
git diff is to find the differences between to commits using the commit ids
git -diff <id1> <id2>

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

We have all the changes tracked, this might not be a problem even if we break something.
