When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share/ collaborate my code with other developers, I prefer using github/ remote.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

when there are multiple branches and keeping a track of them is difficult
