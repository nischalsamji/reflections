When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share/ collaborate my code with other developers, I prefer using github/ remote.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

when there are multiple branches and keeping a track of them is difficult

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork - clone on github
clone - copy on local
branches - different versions originating from one main line.
